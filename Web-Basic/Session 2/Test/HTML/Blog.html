        <h2>Do You Even Need a Free Blogging Platform?</h2>
        <p>
            The truth: <br><br>

            Blogging can be expensive. <br><br>

            If you’re a seasoned blogger who’s been around the block a time or two, who’s already figured out which
            ideas work and which don’t, it’s easy to chalk up these costs as the price of doing business. Spend
            money,
            <a href="">make money</a>. Wash, rinse, and repeat. <br><br>

            But what if you’re a beginner learning <a href="">how to start a blog</a> for the first time? What if
            you’re
            someone who
            hasn’t yet figured what works and what doesn’t? <br><br>

            I’ll let you in on a secret… <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>You can experiment just as well on a free blog site as you can on a self-hosted WordPress blog setup
            with
            all the bells and whistles.</h3>
        <p>
            Actually, you can experiment better on a free blogging platform since the learning curve isn’t as steep.
            <br><br>

            Do you really want to experience the inevitable growing pains of blogging while forking over large piles
            of
            cash each month? <br><br>

            Free blogging platforms allow you to confirm your new blog topic has potential, spy on the competitors
            in
            your niche, and test your ideas without spending any of your hard-earned dough. <br><br>

            So which one is best? <br><br>

            Well, that’s the thing: <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>No Blog Platform Is Right for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
            Different bloggers have different needs, and different blog platforms are good for different things.
            Ultimately, “best” will depend on you and your situation. <br><br>

            That said, each of the platforms we’ll discuss do have common traits (besides being free). Let’s briefly
            look at them before we dive in: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There’s zero maintenance hassle.</strong> The burden of maintenance doesn’t fall on you when you use a free
                blogging
                platform. No worries about software updates, CSS or HTML tweaks, data backups, or gremlins hacking your
                server — they’re all handled by someone else.</li>
            <li><strong>They’re easy to use.</strong> To varying degrees, each platform is user friendly to beginners. With limited tech
                savviness, you could get started today.</li>
            <li><strong>Customization is limited.</strong> If you’re a micromanager, take a deep breath: you will not have full control
                or
                unlimited options when you use a free blogging platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That last one can be both a blessing and a curse. <br><br>

            Once you get serious about blogging, the limited customization options of free platforms will likely hold
            you back. When you’re just starting though, the limitations will help you focus on what’s important: the
            aforementioned testing of your ideas. <br><br>

            Alright, enough prologue. <br><br>

            Ready to find out which platform is best for you? Let’s go. <br><br>
