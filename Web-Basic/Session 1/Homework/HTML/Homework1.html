        Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first
        appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He
        appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, as well as in a number of movies, television shows,
        and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe. In the stories, Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker,
        an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were
        killed in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial
        issues, and accompanied him with many supporting characters, such as J. Jonah Jameson, Harry Osborn, Max Modell,

    <h1>Deadpool</h1>
    <p id = "dead">
        Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
        Comics. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/writer Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in The New
        Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made his
        first appearance in The New Mutants and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable
        antiheroic persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured mercenary with the superhuman
        ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth"
        because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the fourth wall for humorous effect and
        running gags. <br>
        The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series Cable &
        Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei" (though in the
        comic, Reynolds' name is misspelled as "Renolds".)[6][7] Reynolds himself would eventually portray the character
        in the X-Men film series, appearing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Deadpool (2016), and its sequel Deadpool
        2 (2018).[8][9][10] He is slated to continue playing the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[11]
